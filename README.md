## 1. Project description
In today's competitive business landscape, the ability to accurately forecast sales is crucial for effective inventory management, financial planning, and strategic marketing. This project aims to harness the power of data analytics and machine learning to develop a sophisticated sales forecasting model by collecting and integrating sales data from three distinct sources. Additionally, the project will examine the influence of radio and TV advertisements on sales, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of these marketing channels.

The initial phase of the project focuses on data collection from three key sources. By aggregating sales data from these diverse sources, we aim to create a comprehensive dataset that accurately reflects the market dynamics.

Once the data is collected, the next step is data integration. This involves aggregating the sales data from all three sources into a unified dataset, followed by meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. This step is essential to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates, ensuring that the dataset is accurate and reliable. Normalization of the data is also crucial to maintain consistency across different sources, which will facilitate more accurate analysis and modeling.

Data enrichment is a key aspect of this project, focusing on the integration of advertising data with the sales dataset. Specifically, we will incorporate data on radio and TV ad spend, which will be temporally aligned with the sales data to ensure a meaningful correlation analysis. By understanding the relationship between advertising spend and sales, we can identify the impact of marketing efforts on sales performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to uncover key trends, patterns, and anomalies in the sales data. This analysis will involve the use of data visualization techniques to provide insights into the data, helping to inform the development of the forecasting model. Through EDA, we aim to identify significant factors that influence sales, which will be crucial for building an accurate predictive model.

Model evaluation is a critical step to ensure that the forecasting model performs well with real-world data. We will test the model using a holdout dataset to assess its predictive accuracy and validate its performance with actual sales data. This validation process is essential to ensure that the model is practical and reliable for real-world application.

In conclusion, this project aims to enhance sales forecasting accuracy by leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. By integrating sales data from multiple sources and analyzing the impact of radio and TV advertisements, we will develop a robust forecasting model that provides actionable insights and predictive capabilities. This project not only aims to improve sales forecasting but also to inform strategic marketing decisions, ultimately contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.
